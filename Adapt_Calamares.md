Introduction
============

[Calamares](http://calamares.github.io/about/) is an independant installer for Linux distributions which haven't an own one.

As porting ubiquity for Tanglu isn't that easy we decided to use calamares instead.

This page should be a place to putting down ideas and suggestions to adapt Calamares to Tanglus look and feel.

Graphical surface
=================

[300px|thumb|left| Start screen of Calamares](/File:Start_screen1.jpg "wikilink")

This is the current start screen of calamares (KDE live image 03/16/2015).

Problems here:

-   The left pane. Would be better in the same grey tone as the rest of the window.
-   The active menu point would be look better in Tanglu's dark blue or green gradient.
-   The Tanglu logo should be coloured.

Functionality
=============

-   Only en_US.UTF-8 as system locale is currently available.
-   The minimum requirements for Tanglu are a little bit high (1GB RAM) @_@
