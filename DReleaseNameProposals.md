Tanglu "D release" name proposals
---------------------------------

This page collects proposals for the release name of the Tanglu 4 release following 3.0 "Chromodoris willani". The release name must start with a "D" and somehow be connected to the previous one. Here is a short checklist for the release name, to see if it can be used for Tanglu:

 - It must start with a D
 - It must be related to the previous codename "Chromodoris willani" (a sea slug) in some way
 - The relation should be direct. Association chains with too many links are not valid (e.g. Aequorea is a jellyfish which lives in water, water is a chemical compound, so is silicon which is often found in ground, potatoes grow in the ground so the next codename should be "baked potatoe" would be invalid)
 - Relations should not be based on insider knowledge (an exception is stuff very well-known in the Tanglu community)
 - If it is a two-part release name, the first part ("chromodoris" in the previous case) must not contain special caracters. In any other case, the whole name must not contain special caracters.
 - It must not be used as a trademark already
 - Don't create an incredibly long name, as we use the name in the archive and URLs. So, "Satanarchaeolidealcohellish" is not a great release name.

As always, we will do a public vote on the next codename later.
