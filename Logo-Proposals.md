Tanglu Logo Proposals
=====================

Because the double-cycle logo which we used when announcing the project was a bit too close to Debian's logo, as we simply used two Debian logos to make it, we need a new logo.

The metaphor of the two cycles is quite good, so suggestions in how to alter the two-cycle-logo to create a modern-looking logo which is not too close to Debian's logo are welcome! Also, the colours green and blue are preferred, ideally both colours should be present.

However, logo suggestions don't have to look like two circles or match the above criteria. If you have a great idea, just submit it. There are only a few hard requirements:

-   The logo should be iconic
-   It should be relatively simple (can you draw it in sand and still identify it?)
-   It must not already be used by some other product or company
-   It should be licensed under LGPLv3 and/or CC-BY-SA
