Tanglu "B release" name proposals
---------------------------------

This page collects proposals for the release name of the Tanglu release following 1.1 "Aequorea Victoria". The release name must start with a "B" and somehow be connected to the previous one. Here is a short checklist for the release name, to see if it can be used for Tanglu:

-   It must start with a B
-   It must be related to the previous codename "Aequorea Victoria"
-   The relation should be direct. Association chains with too many links are not valid (e.g. Aequorea is a jellyfish which lives in water, water is a chemical compound, so is silicon which is often found in ground, potatoes grow in the ground so the next codename should be "baked potatoe" would be invalid)
-   Relations should not be based on insider facts (an exception is stuff well-known in the Tanglu community)
-   If it is a two-part release name, the first part ("aequorea" in the previous case) must not contain special caracters. In any other case, the whole name must not contain special caracters.
-   It must not be used as a trademark already
-   Don't create an incredibly long name, as we use the name in the archive and URLs. So, "Satanarchaeolidealcohellish" is not a great release name.

We will most likely do a vote on the next release name later.

| Beluga               | Both the "Aequorea Victoria" jellyfish and the Beluga whale are animals and live in water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bioluminescence      | The "Aequorea Victoria" jellyfish is able to glow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bender               | The jellyfish expresses a protein used in science, and [Bender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_%28Futurama%29) the robot is also a scientific/technical object. Also, Bender was the temporary mascot of [Tebidan](/Tebidan "wikilink"), another new-distro effort which fused with Tanglu even before it was announced. For this name, we need to test if we are allowed to use it and if the association with Aequorea doesn't go over too many (2) links.                        |
| Babylonia            | Another beautiful sea creature with fancy name. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia_(gastropod))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bacillus             | My suggest is [Bacillus subtilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis) 'cause is an model organism for the study in science, like Aequorea victoria. [Source](http://lists.tanglu.org/pipermail/tanglu-devel/2013-December/000383.html)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bathysphere          | Spherical deep-sea submersible. The 1930's Bathysphere represented the first time that researchers attempted to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathysphere)
                        Pros:
                        This name is related to marine biology.
                        The bathysphere is connected with a cable to its mother ship as Tanglu is linked to Debian.
                        Cons:
                        Maybe the word is too long and easy to misspell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blennius             | Blennius is a Genus of Perciform fish in the family Blenniidae. Its members include Blennius ocellaris, the Butterfly Blenny. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blennius)
                        Has a curious appearance, would make a good impression on the wallpaper.
                        I like the idea of ​​continuing to give names derived from less widely known sea creatures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bryozoa              | Phylum of aquatic invertebrate animals. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryozoa)
                        Found in marine and freshwater environments so breaks the sea-only-naming-connection.
                        Cool and short word that's not heard very often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Bigelow              | Henry Bigelow, in 1913 stated about Aequorea aequorea "This species has universally been called forskalea, following Peron and Lesueur (1809), but this name was expressly given by them to the Medusa aequorea of Forskal (1775), and all modern authors are agreed that the animal in question is the same that Forskal described" - this statement means that Bigelow felt that A. aequorea is the correct scientific name for everything also called A. forskalea in the literature. |
| Box Jellyfish        | Just another jellyfish family. There are lots of other Jellyfish families listed [here](http://www.marinespecies.org/hydrozoa/aphia.php?p=browser), so it should be possible to find a nice name for (almost) every letter in the alphabet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Bartholomea annulata | It is a sea anemone which is also a cnidaria as Aequorea victoria.
