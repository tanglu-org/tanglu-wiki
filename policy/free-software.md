Free Software Guidelines
========================

The [DFSG](http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) (Debian Free Software Guidelines) apply to Tanglu in every single paragraph. However, one of Tanglu's goals is to create an operating system which can easily installed on many computers without too much deeper knowledge, and which is able to run on almost any computer. This is why we ship proprietary firmware by default, but only the bits which are available in the official Linux kernel. The firmware is the \*\*only\*\* exception from the DFSG.

We will make it possible, for users who want to use proprietary stuff, to be able to install it easily. We will not ship it by default and we will not encourage it's use. But we will also not hide it and don't talk about it on official help pages, if mentioning it helps the users.

Tanglu itself will remain 100% free as in freedom.
