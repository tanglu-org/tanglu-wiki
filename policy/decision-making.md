Decision making
===============

Tanglu is a community-driven project, which means that every project member has the right to vote for the project's direction. And every community member has the right to submit proposals for Tanglu and implement them.

As the project direction is often not clear, because there might be different technical solutions people prefer or any other issue which is blocking an instant decision, there is a simple process to determine what will be done next.

Task proposal cycle
-------------------

At the end of each Tanglu cycle, people can add proposals for new features Tanglu should get with the next release in form of a wiki page. By creating the page and adding their name(s) on that page, these person or people also sign up for implementing the feature and being responsible for it during a cycle. A proposal should include at least the following sections: \*\*TODO\*\*

At the second step, the proposals are checked by the project team, and all sane and complete proposals are discussed on the _tanglu-project_ mailinglist. If there are no concerns raised by someone within 1 or 2 months, the proposal can be accepted.
