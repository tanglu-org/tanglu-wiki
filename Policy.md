Tanglu Policy
=============

These are the main documents describing the Tanglu project policies. You may want to read about the [project goals](//project-goals "wikilink") first.

This stuff is under construction! The final policy is maintained in a Git repository, so these Wiki pages are used for brainstorming at time (until the real policy document has been written).

Social policies
---------------

[Free and open source software](//free-software "wikilink")

[Decision making process](//decision-making "wikilink")

Technical policies

[Basic packaging policy](//packaging "wikilink")

Relation to Debian
