Tanglu Policy
=============

These are the main documents describing the Tanglu project policies. You may want to read about the [project goals](/policy/project-goals) first.

This stuff is under construction! The final policy is maintained in a Git repository, so these Wiki pages are used for brainstorming at time (until the real policy document has been written).

[Free and open source software](/policy/free-software)

[Decision making process](/policy/decision-making)
